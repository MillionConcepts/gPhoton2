# GFCat: The \[G]ALEX \[F]lare \[Cat]alog (+ other variables).
The GFCat project is mining the GALEX data for serendipitous variables observed by GALEX on timescales shorter than about 30 minutes (a full-depth GALEX visit). This is the working repository for that project.

**The first batch of primary output from this project---the 400 most significant variables in the data---[were presented at AAS 235](https://millionconcepts.com/aas235.html).**

**A secondary output of this project that may be of general interest is a catalog of 120-second depth photometry for all "MIS style" observations collected by GALEX through GR7.** This repository currently contains that (>10Gb) catalog. The Jupyter notebook in `gfcat\00 - Example Workflow.ipynb` provides some guidance on how this catalog can be used.

We are interested in collaborations, especially if they include funding, coauthorships, or doing neat things.
