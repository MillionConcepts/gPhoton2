This directory contains -- or should contain -- three reference tables 
generated from mission .scst files and MAST's catalog databases, formatted as
Snappy-compressed .parquet files: a table of aspect solution data 
(aspect.parquet), a table of per-pointing boresight data (boresight.parquet), 
and a table of visit/eclipse-level metadata (metadata.parquet). They are 
automatically referenced by components of the gPhoton 2 pipeline, but are 
also useful for eclipse selection, data fusion, coverage surveys, etc.

They are not distributed in this GitHub repository. 
[They are currently available here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1aPfLKsZM8x5Pxji0Lh3dUblpo9dyt1IW)
